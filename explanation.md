Converting the Number to Binary: When we say "convert a number to binary," we mean expressing that number in a special way that uses only 0s and 1s. Just like how in our normal numbers we use digits from 0 to 9, in binary, we only use 0s and 1s. For example, the number 5 in binary is 101.

Counting the 1s: Now, imagine you have this binary representation of a number. What if we want to count how many 1s are there in this binary number? That's what we're doing first. We're going through each digit of the binary number and counting how many times we see the number 1.

Recording the Positions of 1s: Not only do we want to know how many 1s are there, but we also want to know where they are located. Imagine you have a row of boxes, and some of them contain toys (1s) while others are empty (0s). We want to know which boxes have toys. So, as we count the 1s, we also note down in which positions we found them.

Returning the Results: After we finish counting and noting down the positions, we put together all this information. First, we say how many 1s we found. Then, we list out the positions where we found those 1s.
